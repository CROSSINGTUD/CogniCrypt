=== Configurator Tasks/Problems

- XOR groups are currently not displayed. They should be displayed as a drop-down menu (see Security level for example)
- CryptoTasks.cfr model --> currently no instances found. (could it be because maxInt needs to be setup somewhere?)
- The user should be able to click "Next" without having to change any values
- We need better default values.. I'm still figuring a way to do that in the model, but maybe we could have some defaults in the properties
file for things like output length etc. ?
- Not sure if this is a problem or not currently since I couldn't test it but if no instances are found and the user updates the constraints
and clicks next again, she should be able to get new instances
- Given the CryptoTasks.cfr model and the input constraints in ExpectedOutput.txt file, make sure you get the expected instances
- "Prettier" formatting of displayed instances, constraints etc. (better spacing between controls, different font for headers etc.
- Should we have a don't care option for each setting? What if a user doesn't care about the output size?
- Label message of Properties page not being displayed properly (probably too long.. resize box/label?)


===Modeling Tasks/Problems
- Iterations is a user supplied value -- how can we include it in the model and xml output but mark that it should not be
displayed to the user
- how should security levels be combined ?

=================
DONE
=================
I have changed the model to use "description" for all clafers in the new CryptoTasks.cfr model
- Display description instead of task name (can fix label/display name as "description" -- can be set in properties file).
